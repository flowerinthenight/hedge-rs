## hedge-rs

A cluster membership Rust library. It is built on [spindle-rs](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/spindle-rs), a distributed locking library built on [Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/) and [TrueTime](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency). It is a port (subset only) of the original [hedge](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/hedge), which is written in Go. Ported features include:

* Tracking of member nodes - good for clusters with sizes that can change dynamically overtime, such as [GCP MIGs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups#managed_instance_groups), and [Kubernetes Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/);
* Leader election - the cluster elects and maintains a single leader node at all times;
* List of members - get a list of all member nodes at any time;
* Send - any member node can send messages to the leader at any time; and
* Broadcast - any member node can broadcast messages to all nodes at any time.

## Running the sample

First, create the Spanner table for [spindle-rs](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/spindle-rs):

```sql
CREATE TABLE locktable (
    name STRING(MAX) NOT NULL,
    heartbeat TIMESTAMP OPTIONS (allow_commit_timestamp=true),
    token TIMESTAMP OPTIONS (allow_commit_timestamp=true),
    writer STRING(MAX),
) PRIMARY KEY (name)
```

Then you can run the sample like so:

```bash
# Clone and build:
$ git clone https://github.com/flowerinthenight/hedge-rs/
$ cd hedge-rs/
$ cargo build

# Run the first instance. The first host:port is for hedge-rs'
# internal server; the last host:port is for main's test TCP.
# (Use your actual Spanner values.)
$ RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/example \
  projects/p/instances/i/databases/db \
  locktable \
  0.0.0.0:8080 \
  0.0.0.0:9090

# Run this 2nd instance on a different terminal. The first
# host:port is for hedge-rs' internal server; the last
# host:port is for main's test TCP.
# (Use your actual Spanner values.)
$ RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/example \
  projects/p/instances/i/databases/db \
  locktable \
  0.0.0.0:8081 \
  0.0.0.0:9091

# Run this 3rd instance on a different terminal. The first
# host:port is for hedge-rs' internal server; the last
# host:port is for main's test TCP.
# (Use your actual Spanner values.)
$ RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/example \
  projects/p/instances/i/databases/db \
  locktable \
  0.0.0.0:8082 \
  0.0.0.0:9092
```

You can play around by adding more processes, killing the leader process, killing a non-leader process, restarting an existing process, etc.

To test the `send()` and `broadcast()` APIs, you can do something like:

```bash
# Messages starting with 'send' will use the send() API.
$ echo 'send this message to leader' | nc localhost 9091

# Messages starting with 'broadcast' will use the broadcast() API.
$ echo 'broadcast hello all nodes!' | nc localhost 9092
```

## Runing the sample on a GCP MIG

A sample cloud-init [startup script](./startup-gcp-mig.sh) is provided for spinning up a [Managed Instance Group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups#managed_instance_groups) with the sample code running as a systemd service. You need to update the `ExecStart` section first with your actual Spanner connection URL and table name.

```bash
# Create a launch template. The provided --service-account
# will provide access to Spanner.
$ gcloud compute instance-templates create hedge-tmpl \
  --machine-type e2-micro \
  --service-account=name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --scopes=cloud-platform \
  --metadata=startup-script=''"$(cat startup-gcp-mig.sh)"''

# Create the MIG. Update {target-region} with actual value.
$ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create hedge-mig \
  --template hedge-tmpl --size 3 --region {target-region}

# Let's use 'https://github.com/flowerinthenight/g-ssh-cmd'
# to tail the logs from all three VMs.
$ brew install flowerinthenight/tap/g-ssh-cmd

# Assuming your 'gcloud' is configured properly:
$ g-ssh-cmd mig hedge-mig 'journalctl -f'

# On a different terminal, SSH to one of the VMs and try:
$ echo 'broadcast hello all nodes!' | \
  nc $(cat /etc/hedge/internal-ip) 9090
```
